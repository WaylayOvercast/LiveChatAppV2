<h2>Alternative to my Live Chat App, this time including voicechat</h2>                                                                  


<h5>Currently this remains a WIP,</h5> <h7>The init commit will include very bare bones webRTC
connection for videochat and a socket connection to a node server 
in order to support text chat at the same time.</h7>
<h5>libraries and tech:<h5>
 <p>React, Node, Express, Socket.io, PeerJs, concurrently(will probably be removed), nodemon</p>
